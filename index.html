            <em><mark>volleyball</mark></em> <small>game played</small> by two teams, usually of six players on a side,in which the players use their
            hands to bat a ball back and forth over a high net,trying to make the ball touch the court within 
            opponents’playing area before it can be returned. <br><br>To prevent this a player on the opposing team bats
            the ball up and toward a teammate before it touches the court surface—that teammate may then volley it back across the net or bat it to a third teammate who volleys it across the net.
            A team is allowed only three touches of the ball before it must be returned over the net.

           <blockqoute>"Over the years, I realized that if I'd done everything possible to prepare myself for matches and tournaments, it took a weight off my shoulders and allowed me to play without fear of losing. When you've done everything you can to train yourself for competition, you'll sleep well when the tournament is over, win or lose." -- Karch Kiraly</blockqoute>
